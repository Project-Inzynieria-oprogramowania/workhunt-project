# WorkHunt Project
A web application that allows you to find a vacancy or workers for your vacancy.
Here you can find a vacancy for every taste using the search bar and convenient filters. By registering on our site, you will have access to additional features such as job tracking, notifications and reviews. If you are a representative of an organization, you can create your organization profile, to place your job advertisement.

## Technology
Our project will use the **Ruby on Rails** framework to create connections between the database, models and views. The front end will use standard hypertext language (**HTML**), processed by the framework, **CSS** for styles and **JavaScript** for comfortable and understandable use of GIU.
